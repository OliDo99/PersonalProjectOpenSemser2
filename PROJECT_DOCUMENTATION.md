# Employee Scheduling System - Project Documentation

## Project Overview
This project implements an employee scheduling system for Dominos with user authentication, availability management, and automated schedule generation. The system allows employees to input their availability and administrators to generate and manage work schedules based on staffing requirements.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 1. Manage & Control
- **Infrastructure Management:**
  - Implemented Flask-based web application with clear separation of concerns
  - Utilized JSON file storage for data persistence ( will use DB for final Demo)
  - Established user authentication system with admin and regular user roles
  - Maintained version control and project structure

**Evidence:**
- Authentication system in `auth.py`
- Structured data storage in JSON files (`availability.json`, `schedule.json`, etc.)
- Later I will use a DB
- Clear project organization with separate static and template directories

### 2. Realise
- **Software Development:**
  - Developed core scheduling algorithm in `schedule.py`
  - Implemented user interface with HTML templates and CSS styling
  - Created REST API endpoints for data management
  - Integrated authentication with application features

**Evidence:**
- Schedule generation algorithm in `ScheduleGenerator` class
- REST endpoints in `main.py` for availability and schedule management
- Responsive UI design in `static/css/style.css`
- Integration testing capabilities in `templates/testing.html`

### 3. Design
- **Component Architecture:**
  - Designed modular system with separate components for:
    - Authentication (auth.py)
    - Schedule Generation (schedule.py)
    - User Interface (templates/)
    - API Endpoints (main.py)
  - Implemented responsive and user-friendly interface
  - Created reusable CSS components

**Evidence:**
- Modular blueprint system for authentication
- Reusable UI components in templates
- Structured CSS with clear naming conventions
- JSON-based data models for flexibility

### 4. Advise
- **Process Organization:**
  - Implemented clear user workflows for:
    - Availability submission
    - Schedule generation
    - Administrative controls
  - Established data validation procedures
  - Created user-friendly error handling

**Evidence:**
- Structured route handlers in `main.py`
- Form validation and error handling in templates
- Clear separation between admin and user functionalities
- Informative flash messages for user feedback

### 5. Analysis
- **Development Process:**
  - Analyzed requirements for:
    - User authentication
    - Schedule generation algorithm
    - Data storage needs
  - Implemented solutions using established patterns
  - Created structured error handling and validation

**Evidence:**
- Requirements implementation in schedule generation algorithm
- Data validation in route handlers
- Error handling in availability management
- Clear separation of concerns in codebase

## Technical Stack
- **Backend:** Python with Flask framework
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Data Storage:** JSON files
- **Authentication:** Flask-Login
- **UI Framework:** Custom CSS

## Future Improvements
1. Database Implementation: Replace JSON storage with a proper database
2. Enhanced Error Handling: Add more comprehensive error messages
3. Testing Suite: Implement automated tests
4. API Documentation: Create comprehensive API documentation
5. Performance Optimization: Improve schedule generation algorithm efficiency
